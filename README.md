Two Unity projects contain main feature prototypes. They deploy to Xcode to produce iPhone apps.
### [ARImageTracking](MyWuffAR/ARImageTracking/)
It scans image tags and instantiates two different 3D objects.
### [ARPlaceObject](MyWuffAR/ARPlaceObject)
It accepts a tap action and instantiates a ball object. A dog object with animations fetches the ball to you.
